Project: Modelling the Expansion of the Universe using the Friedmann eqns

The scripts included are detailed below:

'friedmann_closed.py' : Approx model of the Closed Universe (ending in the big crunch)

'friedmann_open.py'   : Model of the Open universe (expansion continues)

'friedmann_flat.py'   : Model of the flat universe (believed to be what our universe is)

'friedmann_matter.py' : Plots the three competing scenarios of a matter dominated universe


After these scripts plan is to extend the flat friedmann universe model by plotting Hubble diagrams of SNe Ia
and reading off a(t) directly. 

Extinction Corrections will be applied, K-corrections not to be applied
Filters: B,V,i (to begin with, might extend to the NIR)

These scirpts will be added once completed and finalised.
