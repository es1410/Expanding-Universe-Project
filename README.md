This GitHub Repository Contains all the code written for 
this project. It is split into three parts:
1. The Friedmann Models
2. Carnegie Supernova Project Data
3. Hubble Diagram Scripts

Within each branch there will be individual 'README' docs 
outlining the purpose of each script. 

==========================================================
General Outline of Project:

The scripts in this repository serve two purposes. The 
first models the universe based on the Friedmann eqns
and produces plots for closed, open, flat universe with
both matter and radiation approximations shown.

The second part, has all the experimental data from CSP, 
and the relevant scripts that allow for the creation of 
the Hubble diagram to be made. 

NOTE:
The SNe Ia used in this project are of low redshift, z<<0.1.
Ideally a range of redshifts would have been used, but 
this was the only public data that I could find, however
the code written can easily be altered to work for a range
of SNe Ia redshifts.
